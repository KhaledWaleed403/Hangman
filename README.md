# Hangman

This is a graphical implementation of the classic Hangman game developed in Java. 

The game challenges players to guess a randomly selected word by clicking on letter buttons, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost.



Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Java Swing for an interactive experience.

Alphabet Buttons: Fully clickable buttons for each letter of the alphabet.

Guesses: Buttons become unclickable once you choose a letter as a guess, this allows the player to avoid guessing the same letter.

Random Level Selection: Levels are randomly selected from a predefined list by clicking on the "Randomize" button in the main menu.

Manual Level Selection: Levels are selected by clicking on one of the number buttons.

Reset Functionality: Allows the game to be reset without restarting the application.




Java: The core programming language.

Java Swing: For building the GUI.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Modular design for reusability and maintainability.
